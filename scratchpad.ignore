os.popen('cat /etc/services').read()
Edit: I'm told that subprocess is a much better way to solve this, so here's the corresponding code:

import subprocess

proc = subprocess.Popen(["cat", "/etc/services"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
(out, err) = proc.communicate()
print "program output:", out
